# Change Management

### How to make a change

- Upgrade software, patch an application, change firewall configuration, modify switch ports

### One of the most common risks in the enterprise

- Occurs very frequently

### Often overlooked or ignored

- Did you feel that bite?

### Have clear policies

- Frequency, duration, installation process, rollback procedures

### Sometimes extremely difficult to implement

- It's hard to change corporate culture

# Change Approval Process

### A formal process for managing change

- Avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes

### A typical approval process:

1. Complete the request forms
2. Determine the purpose of the change
3. Identify the scope of the change
4. Schedule a date and time of the change
5. Determine affected systems and the impact
6. Analyze the risk associated with the change
7. Get approval from the change control board
8. Get end-user acceptance after the change is complete

# Ownership

### An individual or entity needs to make a change

- They own the process
- The don't (usually) perform the actual change

### The owner manages the process

- Process updates are provided to the owner
- Ensures the process is followed and acceptable

### Example: Address label printers needs to be upgraded

- Shipping & Receiving department owns the process
- IT handles the actual change

# Stakeholders

### Who is impacted by this change?

- They'll want to have input on the change management process

### This may not be as obvious as you might think

- A single change can include one individual or the entire company

### Example: Upgrade software used for shipping labels

- This affects: 
  - Shipping/receiving department
  - Accounting reports
  - Product delivery timeframes
  - Revenue recognition - CEO visibility

# Impact Analysis

### Determine a risk value

- i.e., high, medium, low

### The risks can be minor or far-fetching

- The "fix" doesn't actually fix anything
- The fix breaks something else
- Operating system failures
- Data corruption

### What's the risk with NOT making the change?

- Security vulnerability
- Application unavailability
- Unexpected downtime to other services

# Test Results

### Sandbox testing environment

- No conneciton to the real world or production system
- A technological safe space

### Use before maknig a change to production

- Try the upgrade, apply the patch
- Test and confirm before deployment

### Confirm the backout plan

- Move everything back to the original
- A sandbox can't consider every possibility

# Backout Plan

### The change will work perfectly and nothing will ever go bad

- Of course it will

### You should always have a way to revert your changes

- Prepare for the worst, hope for the best

### This isn't as easy as it sounds

- Some changes are difficult to revert

### Always have backups

- GOOD backups

# Maintenance Window

### When is the change happening?

- This might be the most difficult part of the process

### During the workday may not be the best option

- Potential downtime would affect a large part of production

### Overnights are often a better choice

- Challenging for 24-hour production schedules

### The time of year may be a consideration

- Retail networks are frozen during the holiday season

# Standard Operating Procedure

### Change management is critical

- Affects everyone in the organization

### The process must be well documented

- Should be available on the Intranet
- Along with all standard processes and procedures

### Changes to the process are reflected in the standards

- A living document
