# Choosing the Framework

### Identifying weaknesses

### The Final Comparison
- Detailed baseline objectives
- A clear view of the current state
### Need a path to get from the current security to the goal
- This will almost certainly include time, money, and lots of change control
### Time to create the gap analysis report
- A formal description of the current state
- Recommendations for meeting the baseline
