# Power Resiliency
### Power is the foundation of our technology
- It's important to properly engineer and plan for outages
### We usually don't make our own power
- Power is likely provided by third-parties
- We can't control power availability
### There are ways to mitigate power issues
- Short power outages
- Long-term power issues
# UPS
### Uninterruptible Power Supply
- Short-term backup power
- Blackouts, brownouts (drop in voltage), surges (excessive amount of voltage)
### UPS Types
- Offline/standby UPS
- Line-interactive UPS
- On-line/Double-conversion UPS
### Featuers
- Auto shutdown, battery capacity, outlets, phone line suppression
# Generators
### Long-term power backup
- Fuel storage required
### Power an entire building
- Some power outlets may be marked as generator-powered
### It may take a few minutes to get the generator up to speed
- Use a battery UPS while the generator is starting
