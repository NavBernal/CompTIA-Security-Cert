# High Availability
### Redundancy doesn't always mean always available
- May need to be powered on manually
### HA (High Availability)
- Always on, always available
### May include many different components working together
- Active/Active can provide scalability advantages
### Higher availability almost always means higher costs
- There's always another contingency you could add
- Upgraded power, high-quality server components, etc.
# Server Clustering
### Combine two or more servers
- Appears and operates as a single large server
- Users only see one device
### Easily increase capacity and availability
- Add more servers to the cluster
### Usually configured in the operating system
- All devices in the cluster commonly use the same OS

- The users are at the bottom and communicate with the servers using a switch
- In order for these servers to stay synchronized with each other, they don't store data in their local drives but instead all store data in a shared storage drive
- They'll all use that single shared-storage so that all of those servers always have up-to-date data that they're referencing
# Load Balancing
### Load is distributed across multiple servers
- The servers are often unaware of each other
### Distribute the load across multiple devices
- Can be different operating systems
### The load balancer adds or removes devices
- Add a server to increase capacity
- Remove any servers not responding

# Site Resiliency
### Recovery site is prepped
- Data is synchronized
### A disaster is called
- Business processes failover to the alternate processing site
### Problem is addressed
- This can take hours, weeks, or longer
### Revert back to the primary location
- The process must be documented for both directions
# Hot Site
### An exact replica
- Duplicate everything
### Stocked with hardware
- Constantly updated
- You buy two of everything
### Applications and software are constantly updated
- Automated replication
### Flip a switch and everything moves
- This may be quite a few switches
# Cold Site
### No hardware
- Empty building
### No data
- Bring it with you
### No people
- Bring in your team
# Warm Site
### Somewhere between cold and hot
- Just enough to get going
### Big room with rack space
- You bring the hardware
# Geographic Dispersion
### These sites should be physically different than the organization's primary location
- Many disruptions can affect a large area
- Hurricane, tornado, floods, etc.
### Can be a logistical challenge
- Transporting equipment
- Getting employee's on-site
- Getting back to the main office
# Platform Diversity
### Every operating system contains potential security issues
- You can't avoid them
### Many security vulnerabilities are specific to a single OS
- Windows vulnerabilities don't commonly affect Linux or macOS
- And vice versa
### Use many different platforms
- Different applications, clients, and OSes
- Spread the risk around
# Multi-Cloud Systems
### There are many cloud providers
- Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
### Plan for cloud outages
- These can sometimes happen
### Data is both geographically dispersed and cloud service dispersed
- A breach with one provider would not affect the others
- Plan for every contingency
# COOP (Continuity of Operations Planning)
### Not everything goes according to plan
- Disasters can cause a disruption to the norm
### We rely on our computer systems
- Technology is pervasive
### There needs to be an alternative
- Manual transactions
- Paper receipts
- Phone calls for transaction approvals
### These must be documented and tested before a problem occurs
