I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security+. I want you to act as if you are my tutor preparing me for the test. I am going to ask you about a bunch of different concepts, I want your answers to include a few things:
1. General overview of the concept.
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam.
Answer all of my questions in this format until I say otherwise. Can you do that for me?

==Smishing==
- Short for 'SMS Phishing'

- Attackers compromise DNS servers or modify the DNS cache to misdirect users to malicious websites

==Tailgating
- Also known as 'piggybacking'
- A physical security threat where an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind someone who has a valid access method
- i.e. following behind an employee who just used their badge to open a door

==Prepending
- Refers to the practice of adding one or more Autonomous System Paths (AS_PATH) segments to the beginning of a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route advertisement
- AS_PATH is a BGP attribute that helps prevent routing loops and influences the selection of the best path for routing in the Border Gateway Protocol

==Typosquatting
- Also known as URL hijacking
- Threat actors register domain names that are similar to legitimate websites but contain typographical errors
- The goal is to lure users who make typing mistakes or are misled by the similarity into visiting the malicious website
- i.e. typing in 'gooogle.com' instead of 'google.com'

- This can include using a false identity or gain the trust of the target

==Watering Hole Attack
- Threat actors compromise a website commonly visited by a specific group or organization by injecting malicious code into it
- When the victims visit the site, their device can become infected

==Trojan Horse
- A type of software that performs unwanted and harmful actions in disguise of a legitimate and useful program
- This type of malware may act like a legitimate program and have all the expected functionalities, but apart from that it will also contain a portion of malicious code that the user is unaware of

==Logic Bomb
- A malicious program that remains dormant until a specific condition is met

==Fileless Virus
- A form of malware that reside's in a computer's RAM without leaving traditional files or traces on the file system

==C2 Server
- Command and Control server
- Allows attackers to maintain control over compromised systems or devices
- Provides a communication channel between the attacker and the infected endpoints
- Enable attackers to execute actions such as data exfiltration, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and further compromise

==Bot
- A malware-infected network host under remote control of a hacker

==Honeypot
- A system that is set up to attract, detect and analyze malicious activity on computer networks
- Used to lure and study attackers to gain info about their tactics, techniques, and motives

==Cryptomalware
- Often referred to as ransomware
- Encrypts the victim's files or system, rendering them inaccessible

==RAT
- Remote Access Trojan
- Allows a remote attacker to control and manipulate a system as if they had physical access to it

==Backdoor
- Refers to an undocumented (and often legitimate) way of gaining access to a program, online service, or an entire computer system

==Spraying Attack
- A technique where attackers try a small number of commonly used passwords against multiple user accounts
- Helps attackers avoid account lockouts that might occur with traditional brute-force attacks
