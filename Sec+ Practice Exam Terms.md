**ChatGPT Prompt:** I am currently studying to get my CompTIA Security+. I want you to act as if you are my tutor preparing me for the test. I am going to ask you about a bunch of different concepts, I want your answers to include a few things:
1. General overview of the concept.
2. What I might need to know about it for the Security+ exam.
Answer all of my questions in this format until I say otherwise. Can you do that for me?

**==Typosquatting**
- Also known as URL hijacking
- Threat actors register domain names that are similar to legitimate websites but contain typographical errors
- The goal is to lure users who make typing mistakes or are misled by the similarity into visiting the malicious website
- i.e. typing in 'gooogle.com' instead of 'google.com'

**==Pretexting**
- A social engineering technique in which an attacker creates a fake scenario or pretext to manipulate individuals into disclosing confidential or personal information
- This can include using a false identity or gain the trust of the target

**==Watering Hole Attack**
- Threat actors compromise a website commonly visited by a specific group or organization by injecting malicious code into it
- When the victims visit the site, their device can become infected

**==Trojan Horse**
- A type of software that performs unwanted and harmful actions in disguise of a legitimate and useful program
- This type of malware may act like a legitimate program and have all the expected functionalities, but apart from that it will also contain a portion of malicious code that the user is unaware of

**==Worm**
- A standalone malicious computer program that typically propagates itself over a computer network to adversely affect system resources and network bandwidth

**==SPIM (Spam Over Internet Messaging)**
- Unwanted and often commercial messages sent to users through instant messaging services

**==PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)**
- Software that is typically installed on a user's PC without clear and informed consent
- Think bloatware on a prebuilt or bundled software installed without the user knowing

**==Rootkit**
-  Malware designed to gain access to a computer or network while remaining hidden from the OS and antivirus

**==Logic Bomb**
- A malicious program that remains dormant until a specific condition is met

**==Fileless Virus**
- A form of malware that resides in a computer's RAM without leaving traditional files or traces on the file system

**==C2 (Command & Control) Server**
- Allows attackers to maintain control over compromised systems or devices
- Provides a communication channel between the attacker and the infected endpoints
- Enable attackers to execute actions such as data exfiltration, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and further compromise

**==Bot**
- A malware-infected network host under remote control of a hacker

**==Honeypot**
- A system that is set up to attract, detect and analyze malicious activity on computer networks
- Used to lure and study attackers to gain info about their tactics, techniques, and motives

**==Cryptomalware**
- Often referred to as ransomware
- Encrypts the victim's files or system, rendering them inaccessible

**==RAT**
- Remote Access Trojan
- Allows a remote attacker to control and manipulate a system as if they had physical access to it

**==Backdoor**
- Refers to an undocumented (and often legitimate) way of gaining access to a program, online service, or an entire computer system

**==Spraying Attack**
- A technique where attackers try a small number of commonly used passwords against multiple user accounts
- Helps attackers avoid account lockouts that might occur with traditional brute-force attacks

**==BIA (Business Impact Analysis)**
- A critical process used in business continuity planning to identify and evaluate the potential effects of disruptions to critical business operations
- It helps organizations understand the impact of different types of disruptions and prioritize recovery efforts to minimize financial, operational, and reputational damage

**==PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**
- A comprehensive system used to manage digital keys and certificates, enabling secure electronic transactions and communications over a network
- Employs public and private keys and a set of roles, policies, and procedures to facilitate secure data exchange, authentication, and encryption
- PKI allows for strong **authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation**

**==HSM (Hardware Security Module)**
- A physical device that provides robust security for managing, processing, and storing cryptographic keys
- They are designed to protect sensitive cryptographic material and ensure secure cryptographic operations, such as encryption, decryption, authentication, and digital signing
- HSMs provide **enhanced security, regulatory compliance, as well as ensure trust and integrity**

**==FDS (Full Disk Encryption)**
- The process of encrypting all the data on a disk drive, including the OS, applications, and user data, to prevent unauthorized access to the info stored on the device
- It protects data at rest by automatically encrypting it and decrypting it when needed, providing robust security against unauthorized access in case the device is lost or stolen
- FDS provides **data protection, compliance, and risk mitigation**

**==EFS (Encrypting File System)**
- A feature of Windows that allows users to encrypt individual files or folders to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Unlike FDE (Full Disk Encryption), EFS provides file-level encryption, enabling more granular control over which data is encrypted
- EFS provides **data protection, granular control, and user-based security**

**==SED (Self Encrypting Drives)**
- Storage devices that automatically and continuously encrypt the data stored on them
- The encryption process occurs at the hardware level, providing strong data protection without impacting system performance
 
**==PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)**
- A data encryption and decryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication
