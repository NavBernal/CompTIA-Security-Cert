# Recovery
### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Get up and running quickly
- Get back to a particular service level
- You're not up and running until the database and web server are operational
- How long did that take?
### Recovery point objective (RPO)
- How much data loss is acceptable?
- Bring the system back online; how far back does data go?
- The database is up, but only provides the last twelve months of data
### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
- Average time required to fix an issue
- This includes time spent diagnosing the problem
- An important metric for determining the cost and time associated with unplanned outages
### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- The time between outages
- Can be used as a prediction or calculated based on historical performance
- Total uptime/number of breakdowns
- Statistically plan for possible outages
