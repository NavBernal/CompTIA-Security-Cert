# 3rd-Party Risk
### Every organization works with vendors
- Payroll, customer relationship management, email marketing, travel, raw materials
### Important company data is often shared
- May be required for cloud-based services
### Perform a risk assessment
- Categorize risk by vendor and manage the risk
### Use contracts for clear understanding
- Make sure everyone understands the expectations
- Use the contract to enforce a secure environment
- If contract is breached, penalties can be applied
# Penetration Testing
### Pentest
- Simulate an attack
### Similar to vulnerability scanning
- Except we actually try to exploit the vulnerabilities
### Often a compliance mandate
- May include a legal requirement
### Regular penetration testing by a 3rd-party
- Very specialized
- Third-party experts are well-versed
# Rules of Engagement
### An important document
- Defines purpose and scope
- Makes everyone aware of the test parameters
### Types of testing and schedule
- On-site physical breach, internal test, external test
- Normal working hours, after 6PM only, etc.
### The rules

# Right-to-Audit Clauses
### Common to work with business partners

- Everyone agrees to the terms and conditions
- Ability to verify security before a breach occurs
# Evidence of Internal Audits
### Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls
- Have a 3rd party perform an audit
### May be required for compliance
- It's a good idea, even without industry standards
### Check for security controls and processes
- Access management, off boarding, password security, VPN controls, etc.
- There's always an opportunity for improvement
### Perform at a reasonable frequency
- A single audit isn't very helpful in the long term

# Independent Assessments
### Bring in a smart person or team to evaluate security and provide recommendations

# Vendor Monitoring
