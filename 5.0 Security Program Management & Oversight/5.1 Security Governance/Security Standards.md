# Security Standards
### A formal definition for using security technologies and processes
- Complete documentation reduces security risk
- Everyone understands the expectations
### These may be written in-house
- Your requirements may be unique
### Many standards are already available
- ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
- NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
# Password
### What makes a good password?
- Every org has their own requirements
- Create a formal password complexity policy
### Define acceptable authentication methods
- No local accounts, only LDAP to the AD database, etc.
### Create policies for secure password resets
- Avoid unauthorized resets and access
### Other password policies
- Password change frequency, secure password storage requirements, password manager options, etc.
# Access Control
### How does an org control access to data?
- Determine which information, at what time
- And under which circumstances
### Define which access control types can be used
- No discretionary, mandatory only, etc.
### Determine how a user gets access
- Require privilege documentation
### Document how access may be removed
- Security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc.
# Physical Security
### Rules and policies regarding physical security controls
- Doors, building access, property security
### Granting physical access
- Different for employees vs. visitors
### Define specific physical security systems
- Electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc.
### Additional security controls
- Mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc.
# Encryption
### Define specific standards for encrypting and securing data
- All things cryptographic
- Can include implementation standards
### Password storage
- Methods and techniques
### Data encryption minimums
- Algorithms for data in use, in transit, and at rest
- Will probably be different for each data state
