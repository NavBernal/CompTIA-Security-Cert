# Physical Penetration Testing
### Operating system security can be circumvented by physical means
- Modify the boot process
- Boot from other media
- Modify or replace OS files
### Physical security is key
- Prevent access by unauthorized individuals
### Assess and test physical security
- Can you enter a building without a key?
- What access is available inside?
- Doors, windows, elevators, physical security processes
# Pentesting Perspectives
### Offensive
- The red team
- Attack the systems and look for vulnerabilities to exploit
### Defensive
- The blue team
- Identify attacks in real-time
- Prevent any unauthorized access
### Integrated
- Create an ongoing process
- Identify and patch exploitable systems and services
- Test again
# Working Knowledge
### How much do you know about the test?
- Many different approaches
### Known environment
- Full disclosure
### Partially known environment
- A mix of known and unknown
- Focus on certain systems or applications
### Unknown environment
- The pentester knows nothing about the systems under attack
- "Blind" test
# Reconnaissance
### Need information before the attack
- Can't rush blindly into battle
### Gathering a digital footprint
- Learn everything you can
### Understand the security posture
- Firewalls, security configurations
### Minimize the attack area
- Focus on key systems
### Create a network map
- Identify routers, networks, remote sites
# Passive Reconnaissance
### Learn as much as you can from open sources
- There's a lot of info out there
- Remarkably difficult to protect or identify
### These sources may include:
- Social media
- Online forums
- Social engineering
- Dumpster diving
- Business organizations
# Active Reconnaissance
### Trying the doors
- Maybe one is unlocked
### Visible on network traffic logs
# Examples:
- Ping/port scans
- DNS queries
- OS scans, OS fingerprinting
- Service scans, version scans
