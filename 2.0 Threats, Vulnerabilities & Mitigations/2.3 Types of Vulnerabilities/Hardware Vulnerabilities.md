# Hardware Vulnerabilities
### We're surrounded by hardware devices
- Many do not have an accessible operating system
### These devices are potential security issues
- A perfect entry point for an attack
### Everything is connecting to the network
- Light bulbs, garage doors, refrigerators, door locks, thermostats, etc.
- IoT is everywhere
### The security landscape has grown
- Time to change your approach
# Firmware
### The software inside of the hardware
- The OS of the hardware device
### Vendors are the only ones who can fix their hardware
- Assuming they know about the problem and care about fixing it
### Trane Comfortlink II Thermostats
- Control the temperature from your phone
- Trane notified of three vulnerabilities in April 2014
- Two patched in April 2015, one in January 2016
# End-of-Life
### EOL (End of Life)
- Manufacturer stops selling a product
- May continue supporting the product
- Important for security patches and updates
### EOSL (End of Service Life)
- Manufacturer stops selling a product
- Support is no longer available for the prouct
- No ongoing security patches or updates
- May have a premium-cost support option
### Technology EOSL is a significant concern
- Security patches are part of normal operation
# Legacy Platforms
### Some devices remain installed for a long time
- Perhaps too long
### Legacy devices
- Older operating systems, applications, middleware
### May be running end-of-life software
- The risk needs to be compared to the return
### May require additional security protections
- Additional firewall rules
- IPS signatures for older operating systems
