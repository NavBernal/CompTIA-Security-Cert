### Supply Chain Risk
### The chain contains many moving parts
- Raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers
### Attackers can infect any step along the way
- Infect different parts of the chain without suspicion
- People trust their suppliers
### One exploit can infect the entire chain
- There's a lot at stake
# Service Providers
### You can control your own security posture
- You can't always control a service provider
### Service providers often have access to internal services
- An opportunity for the attacker
### Many different types of providers
- Network, utility, office cleaning, payroll/accounting, cloud services, system administration, etc.
### Consider ongoing security audits of all providers
- Should be included with the contract
