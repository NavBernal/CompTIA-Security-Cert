# Operating Systems
### A foundational computing platform
- Everyone has an OS
- This makes the OS a very big target
### Remarkably Complex
- An OS typically contains millions of lines of code
- More code means more opportunities for a security issue
### The vulnerabilities are already there
- We just haven't found them
- Typically, security researchers will looks for these vulnerabilities and report them to the OS's manufacturer/maintainer
- Once the manufacturer has verified the vulnerability on their end, they will roll out patches and updates for us to install on our own machines
# A Month of OS Updates
### A normal month of Windows updates
- Patch Tuesday - 2nd Tuesday of each month
- Other companies have similar schedules
### May 9, 2023 - Nearly 50 Security Patches
- 8 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities
- 4 Security Feature Bypass Vulnerabilities
- 12 Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities
- 8 Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities
- 5 Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
- 1 Spoofing Vulnerability

# Best Practices for OS Vulnerabilities
### Always Update
- Monthly or on-demand updates
- It's a race between you and the attackers
### May require testing before deployment
- A patch might break something else
### May require a reboot
- Save all data so that it isn't lost
### Have a fallback plan
- Always ensure you have a good backup in case something goes wrong during the update
- This applies especially to a business/production setting where a patch can cause other niche settings/programs to break
