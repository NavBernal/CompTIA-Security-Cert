# Vulnerabilities
### Many applications have vulnerabilities
- We've just not found them yet
### Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
- The good guys share these with developers
### Attackers keep these yet-to-be discovered holes to themselves
- They want to use these vulnerabilities for personal gain
# Zero-Day Attacks
### Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities
- They create exploits against these vulnerabilities
### The vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists
- They don't have a fix for an unknown problem
### Zero-Day Attacks
- An attack without a patch or method of mitigation
- A race to exploit the vulnerability or create a patch
- Difficult to defend against the unknown
