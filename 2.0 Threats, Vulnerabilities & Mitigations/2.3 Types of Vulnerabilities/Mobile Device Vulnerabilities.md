# Mobile Device Security
### Challenging to Secure
- Often needs additional security policies and systems
### Relatively Small
- Can be hard to keep track of
### Almost always in motion
- You never know where it might be
### Packed with sensitive data
- Personal and organizational
### Constantly connected to the internet
- This means there's always a chance of anyone in the world being able to connect to it remotely
# Jailbreaking/Rooting
### Mobile devices are purpose-built systems
- You don't typically have access to the operating system
### Gaining Access
- Android - Rooting
- iOS - Jailbreaking
### Install Custom Firmware
- Replaces the existing OS
### Uncontrolled Access
- Circumvent security features
- The MDM becomes relatively useless due to none of those security policies remaining once the device has been jailbroken
# Sideloading
### Malicious apps can be a significant security concern
- One Trojan horse can create a data breach
### Manage installation sources
- The global or local app store
### Sideloading circumvents security
- Apps can be installed manually without using an app store
- Again, this makes MDM relatively useless
