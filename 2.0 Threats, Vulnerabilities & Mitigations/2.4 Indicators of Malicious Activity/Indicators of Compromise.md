### Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
### An event that indicates an intrusion
- Confidence is high
- He's calling from inside the house
### Indicators
- Unusual amount of network activity
- Change to file hash values
- Irregular international traffic
- Changes to DNS data
- Uncommon login patterns
- Spikes of read requests to certain files
# Account Lockout
### Credentials aren't working
- It wasn't you this time
### Exceeded login attempts
- Account is automatically locked
### Account was administratively disabled
- This would be a larger concern
### This may be part of a larger plan
- Attacker locks account
- Calls support line to reset the password
# Concurrent Session Usage
### Multiple account logins from multiple locations
- Interactive access from a single user
### This can be difficult to track down
- Multiple devices and desktops
- Automated process
# Blocked Content
### An attacker wants to stay as long as possible
- Your system has been unlocked
- Keep the doors and windows open
### There's probably a security patch available
- The attacker is going to try and prevent these patches from being applied
### Blocked content
- Auto-update connections
- Links to security patches
- Third party anti-malware sites
- Removal tools
# Impossible Travel
### Authentication logs can be telling
- Logon and logoff
### Login from Omaha, Nebraska
- Company HQ
### Three minutes later, a login from Melbourne, Australia
- Alarm bells should be ringing
### This should be easy to identify
- Log analysis and automation
# Resource Consumption
### Every attacker's action has an equal and opposite reaction
- Watch carefully for significant changes
### File transfers use bandwidth
- An usual spike at 3AM
### Firewall logs show the outgoing transfer
- IP addresses, timeframes
### Often the first real notification of an issue
- The attacker may have been lurking in the system for months
# Resource Inaccessibility
### The server is down
- Not responding
### Network disruption
- A cover for the actual exploi8t
### Server outage
- Result of an exploit gone wrong
### Encrypted data
- A potential ransomware attack begins
### Brute force attack
- Locks account access
# Out-Of-Cycle Loggins
### Out-of-cycle
- Occurs at an unexpected time
### OS patch logs
- Occurring outside of the normal patch day
- Keep that exploited system safe from other attackers
### Firewall log activity
- Timestamps of every traffic flow
- Protocols and applications used
# Missing Logs
### Log information is evidence
- Attackers will try to cover their tracks by removing logs
### Information is everywhere
- Authentication logs
- File access logs
- Firewall logs
- Proxy logs
- Server logs
### The logs may be incriminating
- Missing logs are certainly suspicious
- Logs should be secured and monitored
# Published/Documented
### The entire attack and data exfiltration may go unnoticed
- It happens quite often
### Company data may be published online
- The attackers post a portion or all data
- This may be in conjunction with ransomware
### Raw data may be released without context
- Researchers will try to find the source
