# Physical Attacks
### Old-school security
- No keyboard, no mouse, no command line
### Many different ways to circumvent digital security
- A physical approach must be considered
### If you have physical access to a server, you have full control
- An OS can't stop an in-person attack
### Door locks keep out the honest people
- There's always a way in
# Brute Force
### Push through the obstruction
- Brawn beats brain
### Check your physical security
- Windows
- Doors
### Attackers will try everything
- You should be prepared for anything
# RFID Cloning
### RFID is everywhere
- Access badges
- Key fobs
### Duplicators are on Amazon
- Can be purchased for less than $50
### The duplication process takes seconds
- Read one card
- Copy to another
### This is why we have MFA
- Use another factor with the card such as a PIN, Biometric scan, etc.
# Environmental Attacks
### Attakc everything supporting the technology
- The operating environment
### Power monitoring
- An obvious attack
### HVAC and humidity controls
- Large data centers must be properly cooled
- An attacker could destroy data or cause it to shutdown and become inaccessible by raising the temp too high
### Fire suppression
- Someone who gains access to this system may be able to cause a DoS attack
