# Spyware
### Malware that spies on you
- Advertising, identity theft, affiliate fraud
### Can trick you into installing
- Peer to peer, fake security software
### Browser Monitoring
- Capture surfing habits
### Keyloggers
- Capture every stroke
- Send your keystrokes back to the attacker
# Protecting Against Spyware
### Maintain your anti-virus/anti-malware
- Always have the latest updates/signatures
### Always know what you're installing
- And pay attention to the options during installation
### Where's your backup?
- You might need it someday
- Cleaning adware isn't easy
### Run some scans
- Malwarebytes or any other good anti-malware software should be good at identifying and removing and malware that's found
# Bloatware
### A new computer or phone
- Includes the OS and important apps
### Also includes applications you didn't expect
- And often don't need
### Apps are installed by the manufacturer
- You don't get a choice
### Uses valuable storage space
- May also add to overall resource usage
- The system may be slower than expected
- Could open your system to exploits
# Removing Bloatware
### Identify and Remove
- This may be easier said than done
### Use the built-in uninstaller
- Works for most applications
### Some apps have their own uninstaller
- That's how bad they are
### Third-party uninstallers and cleaners
- Probably not the first option
- Always have a backup
- Revo Uninstaller is a good option
