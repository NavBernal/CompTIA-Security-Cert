# The Pretext
### Before the attack, the trap is set
- There's an actor and a story
### Examples
- "Hello sir, my name is Wendy and I'm from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent check up call for your computer as we have found several problems with it."
- Voicemail: "This is an enforcement action executed by the US Treasury intending your serious attention."
- "Congratulations on your excellent payment history! You now qualify for 0% interest on all of your credit card accounts."
# Impersonation
### Attackers pretend to be someone they aren't
- Done with the goal of accessing information they normally wouldn't
### Use some of those details from reconnaissance
- They learn this company has a large help desk team and pretend to be working as help desk in order to get access to employees' machines or gain classified information
### Attack the victim as someone higher in rank
- Pretending to be from the Vice President of Finance's office
### Throw tons of technical details around to confuse the user
- Example: "Catastrophic feedback due to the depolarization of the differential magnetometer"
### Be a buddy to gain trust
- How about those (insert local team here)?
