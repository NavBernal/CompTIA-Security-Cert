# The Pretext
### Before the attack, the trap is set
- There's an actor and a story
### Examples
- "Hello sir, my name is Wendy and I'm from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent check up call for your computer as we have found several problems with it."
- Voicemail: "This is an enforcement action executed by the US Treasury intending your serious attention."
- "Congratulations on your excellent payment history! You now qualify for 0% interest on all of your credit card accounts."
# Impersonation
### Attackers pretend to be someone they aren't
- Done with the goal of accessing information they normally wouldn't
### Use some of those details from reconnaissance
- They learn this company has a large help desk team and pretend to be working as help desk in order to get access to employees' machines or gain classified information
### Attack the victim as someone higher in rank
- Pretending to be from the Vice President of Finance's office
### Throw tons of technical details around to confuse the user
- Example: "Catastrophic feedback due to the depolarization of the differential magnetometer"
### Be a buddy to gain trust
- How about those (insert local team here)?
# Eliciting Information
### Extracting information from the victim
- The victim doesn't even realize this is happening
- Hacking the human
### Often seen with vishing (voice phishing)
- Can be easier to get this information over the phone
### These are well-documented psychological techniques
- They can't just ask, "So what's your password?"
# Identity Fraud
### Your identity can be used by others
- Keep your personal info safe
### Credit card fraud
- Open an account in your name, or use your credit card information
### Bank fraud
- Attacker gains access to your account or opens a new account
### Loan fraud
- Your information is used for a loan or lease
### Government benefits fraud
- Attacker obtains benefits on your behalf
- Seen with things like tax fraud, where the attacker will send in your tax forms pretending to be you in order to receive the overpayment or tax refund to their account
# Protect Against Impersonation
### Never volunteer information
- "Sure! My password is (blank)"
### Don't disclose personal details
- The bad guys are tricky and would love to gain PII wherever possible
### Always verify before revealing info
- Call back, verify through 3rd parties
### Verification should be encouraged
- Especially if your organization owns valuable information
