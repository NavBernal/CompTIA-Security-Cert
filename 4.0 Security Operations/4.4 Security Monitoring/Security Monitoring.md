# Security Monitoring
### The attackers never sleep
- They're constantly looking for ways to get in
### Monitor all entry points
- Logins, publicly available services, data storage locations, remote access
### React to security events
- Account access, firewall rule base, additional scanning
### Status dashboards
- Get the status of all systems at a glance
# Monitoring Computing Resources
### Systems
- Authentication - logins from strange places
- Server monitoring - service activity, backups, software versions
### Applications
- Availability - Uptime and response times
- Data transfers - Increases or decreases in rates
- Security notifications - From the dev/manufacturer
### Infrastructure
- Remote access systems - Employees, vendors, guests
- Firewall and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) reports - Large spike of attacks
# Log Aggregation
### SIEM or SEM (Security Information and Event Manager)
- Consolidate many different logs to a central database
- Servers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, SANs, cloud services
### Centralized reporting
- All information in one place
### Correlation between diverse systems
- View authentication and access
- Track application access
- Measure and report on data transfers
# Scanning
### A constantly changing threat landscape
- New vulnerabilities discovered daily
- Many different business applications and services
- Systems and people are always moving
### Actively check systems and devices
- Operating system types and versions
- Device driver versions
- Installed applications
- Potential anomalies
### Gather the raw details
- A valuable database of information
# Reporting
### Analyze the collected data
- Create "actionable" reports
### Status information
- Number of devices up to date/in compliance
- Devices running older operating systems
### Determine best next steps
- A new vulnerability is announced
- How many systems are vulnerable?
### Ad hoc information summaries
- Reporting what could happen in the future
- Prepare for the unknown
# Archiving
### It takes an average of about 9 months for a company to identify and contain a breach
- IBM security report, 2022
### Access to data is critical
- Archive over an extended period
### May have a mandate
- State or federal law
- Or organizational requirements
# Alerting
### Real-time notifications of security events
- Increase in authentication errors
- Large file transfers
### Actionable Data
- Keep the right people informed
- Enable quick response and status information
### Notification methods
- SMS/text
- Email
- Security console/SOC
# Alert Response & Remediation
### Quarantine
- A foundational security response
- Prevent a potential security issue from spreading
### Alert tuning
- A balancing act
- Prevent false positives and false negatives
### An alert should be accurate
- This is an ongoing process
- The tuning gets better as the time goes on
