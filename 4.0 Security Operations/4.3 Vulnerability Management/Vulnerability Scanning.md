# Vulnerability Scanning
### Usually minimally invasive
- Unlike a penetration test
### Port scan
- Poke around and see what's open
### Identify systems
- And security devices
### Test form the outside and inside
- Don't dismiss insider threats
### Gather as much information as possible
- We generally have to go through vulnerability reports to separate the real vulnerabilities from the false positives
# Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)
### Send random input to an application
- Fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing
### Looking for something out of the ordinary
- Application crash, server error, exception
### 1988 class project at the University of Wisconsin
- "Operating System Utility Program Reliability" class
- Taught by Professor Barton Miller
- He and his students created the Fuzz Generator
# Fuzzing Engines and Frameworks
### Many different fuzzing options
- Platform specific, language specific, etc.
### Very time and processor resource heavy
- Many, many different iterations to try
- Many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests
### Carnegie Mellon Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)
- CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)

# Package Monitoring
### Some applications are distributed in a package
- Especially open source
- Supply chain integrity
### Confirm the package is legitimate
- Trusted source
- No added malware
- No embedded vulnerabilities
### Confirm a safe package before deployment
- Verify the contents
