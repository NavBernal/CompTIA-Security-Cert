# Exercising
### Test yourselves before an actual event
- Scheduled update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc.)
### Use well-defined rules of engagement
- Don't touch the production systems
### Very specific scenario
- Limited time to run the event
### Evaluate response
- Document and discuss
# Tabletop exercises
### Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly
- And time-consuming
### Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
- You don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill
### Get key players together for a tabletop exercise
- Talk through a simulated disaster
# Simulation
### Test with a simulated event
- Phishing attack, password requests, data breaches
### Going phishing
- Create a phishing email attack
- Send to your actual user community
- See who bites
### Test internal security
- Did the phishing get past the filter
### Test the users
- Who clicked?
- Additional training may be required
# Root Cause Analysis
### Determine the ultimate cause of an incident
- find the root cause by asking "why"
### Create a set of conclusions regarding the incident
- Backed up by the facts (i.e. log files)
### Don't get tunnel vision
- There can be more than one root cause
### Mistakes happen
- Sometimes the root is a mistake made by an employee
- The response to the mistake is the difference
# Threat Hunting
### The constant game of cat and mount
- Find the attacker before they find you
### Strats are constantly changing
- Firewalls get stronger, so phishing gets better
### Intelligence data is reactive
- You can't see the attack until it happens
### Speed up the reaction time
- Use tech to fight
