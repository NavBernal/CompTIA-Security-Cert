# Password Complexity and Length
### Make your password strong
- Resist guessing or brute-force attack
### Increase password entropy
- No single words, no obvious passwords
- Mix upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters
### Stronger passwords are commonly at least 8 characters
- These requirements change as processing speed gets faster
- Consider a phrase or set of words
# Password Age and Expiration
### Password age
- How long since a password was modified
### Password expiration
- Password works for a certain amount of time
- 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.
- After the expiration date, the password doesn't work
- System remembers password history, requires unique passwords
### Critical systems might change more frequently
- Every 15 days or every week
# Password Managers
### Important to use different passwords for each account
- Remembering all of them would be impractical
### Store all of your passwords in a single database
- Encrypted, protected
- Can include multifactor tokens
### Built-in to many operating systems
- And some browsers
### Enterprise Password Managers
- Centralized management and recovery options
# Passwordless Authentication
### Many breaches are due to poor password control
- Weak passwords, insecure implementation
### Authenticate without a password
- This solves many password management issues
### You may already be passwordless
- Facial recognition, security key, etc.
### Passwordless may not be the primary authentication method
- Used with a password or additional factors
# Just-In-Time Permissions
### In many orgs, the IT team is assigned admin/root elevated account rights
- This would be a great account to attack
### Grant admin access for a limited time
- No permanent admin rights
- The principle of least privilege
### A breached user account never has elevated rights
- Narrow the scope of a breach
### Request access from a central clearing house
- Grants or denies based on predefined security policies
### Password vaulting
- Primary credentials are stored in a password vault
- The vault controls who gets access to credentials
### Accounts are temporary
- Just-in-time process creates a time-limited account
- Administrator receives ephemeral credentials
- Primary passwords are never released
- Credentials are used for one session then deleted
